Taxes in Illinois Explained","body":"## We might not make you love it, but we’ll help you understand it.\n\nEvery year Tax Day rolls around like a test you’ve barely prepared for on a subject that still makes no sense. Oh, and if you fail, you go to prison. While we can’t promise to make you love tax day, we can at least help you understand it.\n\nTaxes in Illinois are contentious and confusing. Some people complain that our taxes are the highest in the country, while others complain they are among the lowest. And because comparing taxes is complicated, both those groups of folks are right. That’s why we are here to help.\n\nHere are the basics. All year you pay taxes on the things you buy. Twice a year you pay taxes on the property you own. Once a year you pay taxes on the investments you hold and the income you make. Depending on how you view it, Illinois could be called a __high tax state__ (our property taxes are among the highest in the country), an __average tax state__ (our sales taxes are right in the middle), or a __low tax state__ (the state has comparatively low individual and corporate income taxes and sales taxes on services).\n\nMaking things even more complicated, all of that tax revenue doesn’t all go to the same place. Most state tax revenue goes to state government agencies, but property tax revenue stays at the local level.\n\nLet’s break that down.\n\n\n\n## State Income Tax\n\nOn April 17th this year, most people will file their state and federal income taxes. Our individual state income tax rate is relatively low. Seven states do not tax income, most others — 34 along with the federal government — tax income using a graduated system where people who earn less pay a smaller percentage of their income in taxes and wealthier people contribute more. [Illinois is one of nine states with a flat-rate income tax](http://www.businessinsider.com/state-income-tax-rate-rankings-by-state-2018-2), which means the state taxes income at the same rate for everyone, regardless of how much people earn. In Illinois, the flat state income tax is currently 4.95% for all individuals. That rate is set by the state Legislature, and it gets set and changed just like any state law (shoutout to our [overview of the legislative session in Illinois](https://medium.com/state-matters/how-does-session-work-in-illinois-456d59c487e9)!).\n\n\n  ###  How is That Money Used?\n\n\n\n|      |\n| ---------- |\n| ![1 - How is that money used?](//images.ctfassets.net/021ulla0m5co/ehbUt9nWHm2EwsOSC8gyw/22a9a2451bd21c6bff9acef1b97f4b8b/1_-_How_is_that_money_used_.png)      |\n| From Comptroller’s website: [http://www.revenue.state.il.us/AboutIdor/TaxStats/2017-IL-1040-Comptrollers-Report.pdf](http://www.revenue.state.il.us/AboutIdor/TaxStats/2017-IL-1040-Comptrollers-Report.pdf)       |\n\n\n\n\n\nYour state income tax revenue goes to everything from K-12 schools, state universities, and teacher pension funds, to medical assistance, early-childhood care, state police, and a host of other agencies. Most of this revenue (almost half) comes from individual income tax. The state’s second largest source of tax revenue is state sales tax. The other third of the state’s revenue comes from a combination of business income taxes, gaming taxes, public utility taxes, special sales taxes, and federal funds.\n\nWe will fully breakdown this mumbo jumbo bureaucratic system later this year in our state budget explainer. For now, we’re on to property taxes.\n\n\n\n## Property Tax\n\nYou may have heard a lot of talk about Illinois’ property taxes. Property tax rates vary drastically throughout Illinois. This is because property tax rates are set at the local level. The average [across Illinois is 2.13%](http://www.tax-rates.org/illinois/property-tax). That is very high compared both to our neighboring states and to the rest of the county. If you rent, this also affects you, because landlords set your rental prices based in part on how much they pay each year in taxes.\n\nProperty tax rates are set by your local taxing districts. Your local taxing districts include your city or village, education board (which oversees public education), park board, library board, county board, and a range of other local government bodies, depending on where you live. Yes, that’s right, all those board officials on your election ballot that you didn’t didn’t bother to vote for decide how much tax to charge you in order to fund the services they provide. (__Remember to vote.__) Each taxing district hands its rate to the County Treasurer who compiles them into the property tax bill that winds up in your mailbox.\n\n### How Is That Money Used?\n\nMost of your property taxes go to public education. One of the reasons why Illinois has such high local property taxes is because the state contributes less than any other state in the nation to its primary schools — just under one-quarter of the needed school funding. Because the state spends so little on schools, the rest has to come from somewhere. In Illinois, that somewhere is property taxes.\n\n![2 - Public School Funding](//images.ctfassets.net/021ulla0m5co/5jK8vRbaco4mmeqI8ga2qA/5e193e49e8d9732ec763c31f8f89e3d4/2_-_Public_School_Funding.png)\n\nBecause public education systems are mostly funded by their local districts, the state suffers from a huge discrepancy in spending on education. While some districts bring in enough revenue to spend $32,278 on each pupil, others can only afford to spend $8,542.\n\nProperty taxes help fund a lot of other services too. Here are some examples depending on where you live in the state.\n\n![3 - Property Taxes - chicago](//images.ctfassets.net/021ulla0m5co/5ZGiAuCtA4eKCa2KOgsccE/541472e76dfbbdd8ad6f5da1f0f2175d/3_-_Property_Taxes_-_chicago.png)\nSource: [https://www.cookcountyclerk.com/sites/default/files/pdfs/2016%20Tax%20Rate%20Report.pdf](https://www.cookcountyclerk.com/sites/default/files/pdfs/2016%20Tax%20Rate%20Report.pdf)\n\n![5 - property taxes - sangamon county](//images.ctfassets.net/021ulla0m5co/570TYxfEtyUaiWwAauyY0q/cf28ebfb805f7065f9c6886f269adebf/5_-_property_taxes_-_sangamon_county.png)\nSource: [http://co.sangamon.il.us/Portals/0/Departments/Treasurer/Docs/Distribution-Info/2015%20pay%202016/2016%20Distribution%20by%20type%20List.pdf](http://co.sangamon.il.us/Portals/0/Departments/Treasurer/Docs/Distribution-Info/2015%20pay%202016/2016%20Distribution%20by%20type%20List.pdf)\n\n![4 - property taxes - geneva](//images.ctfassets.net/021ulla0m5co/3F0a5Xw18kEesiywyYO000/559f1b8878b80f1bf71c3a3f7e527ebd/4_-_property_taxes_-_geneva.png)\nSource: [https://www.geneva.il.us/ArchiveCenter/ViewFile/Item/1654](https://www.geneva.il.us/ArchiveCenter/ViewFile/Item/1654)\n\nIf you want to know how your property tax dollars are being used, go to the next meeting of your taxing district board and ask them for more information. Outside of Chicago, each taxing district has its own autonomous governing board (school board, library board, park board, etc.), so if you have questions about your school district’s taxing and spending policies, you have to ask the school board, not your city council or county board for information.\n\nIn Chicago, things work a little differently because the Mayor appoints people to most of the big governing boards, like the school board, library board, and park board. It’s still a good idea to direct school funding questions to the Chicago Board of Education, and park funding questions to the Chicago Park Board, because ultimately they are the ones setting your tax rates and deciding how to spend your tax dollars. It’s confusing. We know.\n\n\n\n## The Everyday Taxes:\n\nFinally, everyone pays taxes on goods and services. These taxes should not be overlooked. State sales taxes are the second largest source of revenue for Illinois and local and county sales taxes help fund many important local government activities too.\n\nGoods: Combined, the base state sales tax rate and base local sales tax rate is currently 6.25%. But cities and counties can increase the local sales taxes, meaning that total sales taxes can be as high as 10.25% depending on *where you are in the state*. Illinois’s base sales tax rate is pretty similar to our neighboring states and right in the middle nationally.\n\nServices: Unlike most of our neighbors, Illinois does not tax most services (like car repair, hair cuts/styling, pet grooming, and massage therapy), even though spending on services makes up around two-thirds of the economic activity in the state. Of the 168 categories of taxable services, we only tax 17 and most of those are utilities. As a result, Illinois has one of the lowest sales tax bases in the nation.\n\n\n\n## In Conclusion\n\nWe hope that this gives you a somewhat clear and simple sense of how your taxes are set up and where they go. In Illinois, income tax is low and flat, property taxes can be high and vary, and sales taxes are average but don’t cover all that much. Got it?\n\nYou made it to the end! Congratulations! Now go take a nap, you deserve it.\n\n![Puppy Sleep](//images.ctfassets.net/021ulla0m5co/1eRjQ9vEgousqGq0aS6qGO/b5d858114a1643fdc9cbc2a71f6e6f35/Puppy_Sleep.gif)\n\n\n\ngraphics by Chien-An Yuan","contributor":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"021ulla0m5co"}},"id":"4YAgPSvwROooeCY2mcIAQm","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-06-03T14:49:23.385Z","updatedAt":"2018-06-03T14:49:23.385Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"contributor"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Alexander Jacobs","photo":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"021ulla0m5co"}},"id":"45AnmubDd6AkASGmugioeA","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2018-06-03T14:49:43.584Z","updatedAt":"2018-06-03T14:49:43.584Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"1*qruQJXrbjxWBcSdiI1EzpQ","description":"Alexander Jacobs Alexander Jacobs Editor, Researcher, Writer","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/021ulla0m5co/45AnmubDd6AkASGmugioeA/a62a5daf9698ea0fb2ed8aa179a1b344/1_qruQJXrbjxWBcSdiI1EzpQ.png","details":{"size":66625,"image":{"width":240,"height":240}},"fileName":"1*qruQJXrbjxWBcSdiI1EzpQ.png","contentType":"image/png"}}},"bio":"Editor, Researcher, Writer"}},"photo":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"021ulla0m5co"}},"id":"3Eo59TW0XS48Yo0iOEmckg","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2018-06-03T15:56:26.387Z","updatedAt":"2018-06-03T15:56:26.387Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"0 - hero","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/021ulla0m5co/3Eo59TW0XS48Yo0iOEmckg/2c0488ffde6ce963af4c6af12d7615dc/0_-_hero.jpeg","details":{"size":202402,"image":{"width":1000,"height":354}},"fileName":"0 - hero.jpeg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}}}}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"021ulla0m5co"}},"id":"6yQ21ROmjKOSgAGggAMoCe","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-08-06T20:51:33.345Z","updatedAt":"2018-08-06T21:22:24.545Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":6,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"article"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"The Governor’s Powers","body":"\n\nThe Midterms are almost upon us and you know what that means? You’ll need to pick your fave for Governor. \n\n__But what exactly does the Governor do anyway? __\n\nAs the state’s top elected official, Illinois’ Governor can do a bunch of important things that impact how well the state works and how regular people can access programs and services. The biggies are that the Governor gets to appoint leaders for state agencies, help shape state policy and laws, and grant pardons. \n\nLet’s start with the basics: just like the U.S. federal government, the Illinois state government has three main branches: executive, legislative, and judiciary. The Governor of Illinois is one of six elected members of Illinois’ executive branch. The others are: the Lieutenant Governor, the Attorney General, the Secretary of State, the Comptroller, and the Treasurer. If you aren’t quite sure what all of those folks do, don’t worry, we will have an article explaining that too! \n\nThe Illinois state constitution grants the Governor “supreme executive power” and while that sounds very “The Force Awakens”, it just assigns the Governor the responsibility to enforce state laws. The state constitution goes on to give the Governor five key powers in order to actually exert authority and enforce laws: \n\n- appointing people to state agencies, \n- reorganizing state agencies, \n- granting pardons, \n- helping set the legislative agenda with an annual message, \n- and the power to sign or veto bills passed by the legislature. \n\nNow let’s get on to the good stuff and learn more about each of these powers.\n\n### 1. Appointment \u0026 Removal Power\nThe Governor picks the leaders for all government agencies, commissions, and boards where the state constitution doesn’t outline another process for them to be chosen. These appointees advise the Governor about policy and also help ensure that the Governor’s priorities are carried out by their agencies or commissions. This appointment power is pretty broad, including agencies like:\n\n- the [__Illinois State Police__](http://www.isp.state.il.us/ \"Illinois State Police\") (they are responsible for things like patrolling the state’s highways, issuing Firearm Owner Identification Cards, issuing Amber alerts, and maintaining the state sex offender registry),  \n\n- the [__Illinois Commerce Commission__](https://www.icc.illinois.gov/ \"Illinois Commerce Commission\") (they regulate utilities like power, gas, water, etc.), \n\n- the [__Board of Higher Education__](https://www.ibhe.org/ \"Illinois Board of Higher Education\") (they work to make college accessible to everyone, including things like advocating on behalf of the Monetary Award Program to the Illinois General Assembly),\n\n- and __a whole bunch more__!\n\nBut that power isn't absolute. The Illinois Senate gets to advise and consent on the Governor’s nominees for appointments, just like the U.S. Senate gets to advise and consent on appointments made by the U.S. President. After the Governor nominates someone to fill a position, the Illinois Senate has 60 days to weigh in, and if they don’t like a nominee then they can prevent the appointment through a simple majority vote. If the Governor appoints someone when the Illinois legislature is not in session, they are just an interim appointee and once the legislature is back in session, the Governor has to use the normal nominating procedure, and get the consent of the Illinois Senate. If the Governor nominates someone who is not confirmed by the Illinois Senate, they can’t be nominated again in the future, or serve as a temporary appointee. The Governor can also remove any appointee from office if they have engaged in abuse, neglect or some other form of misconduct. \n\n### 2. Agency Organization \u0026 Reorganization Power\nSince state agencies play such a big role in providing services and information to the state’s residents and visitors, another important Gubernatorial power is being able to organize or reorganize a state agency using an “Executive Order.” Sometimes the Governor can just release an Executive Order to reorganize an agency, or form a new task force or commission, and that’s that (they do, after all, have that “The Force Awakens” level executive power we mentioned). That’s how the [Governor’s Opioid Prevention and Intervention Task Force](https://www2.illinois.gov/Pages/government/execorders/2017_5.aspx) got started in 2017. But, the Governor has to get approval from the Illinois legislature if there is already a law on the books that the Executive Order would impact. When that happens, the Illinois General Assembly has 60 days after the Governor submits an Executive Order to respond. If both chambers (the Illinois House and Illinois Senate) approve the Executive Order with a simple majority then the reorganization is carried out. But, if it fails to pass in either chamber, then the reorganization is disapproved and nothing happens. \n\n### 3. Pardon Power\nIn Illinois, the Governor, and the Governor alone, can grant a pardon, or commute a sentence (immediately end a sentence and release the inmate) for any criminal offense, as long as the conviction was in the state court system. Most petitions for clemency are not granted. In 2017, Governor Bruce Rauner received just over 100 petitions for clemency, and [granted just 5](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/sns-bc-il--illinois-governor-clemencies-20171122-story.html). In recent years, both Governor Rauner, and his predecessor Governor Pat Quinn worked to clear a [big backlog of clemency petitions](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/ct-rauner-clemency-backlog-denials-met-20161212-story.html) left by impeached Governor Rod Blagojevich.\n\n### 4. Legislative Message Power\nThe state constitution gives the Governor the power to give an annual address to the Illinois legislature at the start of each session. In this Legislative Message, the Governor reports on how Illinois is doing, what could be improved, and what steps the legislature could take to improve the state’s condition. Though this power is not as direct as the Governor’s bill signing and veto power, it can help shape public policy and lawmaking.\n\n### 5. Bill Signing \u0026 Veto Power\nThe Governor's bill signing and veto power is a really big deal because it gives the Governor a lot of power in the state lawmaking process. In brief, once the Illinois General Assembly passes a bill (any kind of bill), the Governor reviews it and either signs it into law, or sends it back to the General Assembly with one of 4 types of veto action. The General Assembly always has a chance to overturn a veto action, but they have to have more votes to overturn a veto than they did to pass the bill in the first place. \n\n### BONUS! The Governor’s Emergency Power\nIn addition to the powers laid out in the state constitution, Illinois’ Governor has the power to suspend normal activity or laws during a state of emergency.\n\n### Limits on the Governor’s Power\nEven though the state constitution gives the Governor “supreme executive power,” there are still some limits on that power. If there are suspicions of wrongdoing, the Illinois House of Representatives has the power to launch an investigation and to vote to impeach (remove from office) the Governor. If the Illinois House does vote to impeach, then there is an impeachment trial in the Illinois Senate and the Chief Justice of the Illinois Supreme Court presides at that trial. It requires a ⅔ majority vote from the Illinois Senate to finalize impeachment.  Incidentally, the Illinois House can also investigate and vote to impeach any elected executive officer (Lt. Governor, Attorney General, Secretary of State, Comptroller, and Treasurer) and any sitting judges or justices in the state court system. Just like with the Governor, that’s followed by a trial in the Illinois Senate, and requires a ⅔ vote for impeachment to happen. \n\n### Make a plan to vote!\nNow that you have a better handle on what Illinois’ Governor actually does, the next step is to research the 2018 Gubernatorial candidates on [BallotReady](https://www.ballotready.org) and make a plan to vote!

We did. So now we’re breaking it down for you.\n\n### What is the General Assembly?\nJust like the U.S. Congress, the Illinois Legislature is made up of two chambers: a House of Representatives (with 118 members) and a Senate (with 59 members). Together they’re called the Illinois General Assembly. Their main responsibility is to propose, debate, and enact new legislation that, once approved by both chambers and signed by the Governor, become state laws.\n\n![1 - IL general assembly](//images.ctfassets.net/021ulla0m5co/962upsJWWAsiwus4koSIM/62ad6fdc6747b41fb66d16420b188396/1_-_IL_general_assembly.jpeg)\n\n\n### Legislative Session\nWhen the Illinois General Assembly gets together in Springfield to work, it’s called a __legislative session__. Each state has different rules and schedules for their legislative sessions, Illinois operates with “biennial legislative sessions” meaning each legislative session lasts two years, always starting in January after a general election (the general elections happen in November every even-numbered year). Don’t forget to vote!\n\nEach year of a legislative session can be broken into several distinct time periods: regular session, special session, veto session, and sometimes lame duck session. First, the regular session occurs between January and May/June of each calendar year. There are two regular sessions per legislative session, and bills proposed in the first year of the legislative session can finish making their way through the process in the second year of the session. No wonder it can sometimes seem like it takes forever to get a bill passed in Illinois! During the regular session, the House and the Senate meet separately in Springfield to work on new legislation, or __bills__.\n\nIf a bill is approved by both the House and the Senate, it is sent on to the Governor, who then has __sixty days__ to respond. In any given year, the Illinois Legislature often approves close to a thousand bills — and the vast majority are approved in the last few weeks of the term. This means that a whole lot of bills are sent to the Governor all at once at the end of May or in early June, and that’s why we see the Governor’s response to most bills over the summer. The Governor can either approve the legislation, or take one of four types of veto actions. The Governor can issue a __full veto__, a __line-item veto__, a __reduction veto__, or an __amendatory veto__.\n\n![2 - governor veto](//images.ctfassets.net/021ulla0m5co/7BHEvuFR6MGaUkOKokesc6/40c93ee6e636e48b916bbaee57be58b9/2_-_governor_veto.jpeg)\n\n### Illinois Legislature’s Response to Veto and Veto Session\n\nIf the Governor issues any kind of veto, the Illinois General Assembly always has an opportunity to respond. They can either override it, or make changes to the bill in line with the Governor’s suggestions. While in session, each legislative chamber (the Illinois House and the Illinois Senate) has a maximum of __fifteen days__ to try to override the Governor’s veto, starting with the first chamber that passed the legislation. But since a lot of these vetoes often happen over the summer, after the Legislature’s regular session ends, that time limit for overriding a veto is often postponed until the General Assembly meets again in the fall for a special session, commonly and aptly called a __veto session__.\n\n\n### Special Session\n\nOther than veto session, the Governor or the Legislature can also convene a __special session__ outside of the usual January to May time period, in order to address a specific issue. During the special session, other legislation can also be proposed and debated, and it often is.\n\nThe leaders of both legislative chambers, the Speaker of the House and the President of the Senate, have to agree to call a special session. But the Governor can also act alone to call a special session. This happened, for example, in 2017 when the Governor called the Legislature back into session at the end of June to try and pass a budget agreement after the state had been operating for two years without a formal budget.\n\n### Lame duck session\n\nAnd finally … the lame duck session. If, after the general election in November, the Legislature has unfinished business and needs to meet before the start of the next session, it’s called a lame duck session.\n\n![3 - lame duck](//downloads.ctfassets.net/021ulla0m5co/O6QBJQcG8CK0uyuoQM2sm/e8e86ffe2c811aeb1c0f93319a8c7e47/3_-_lame_duck.gif)\n\nIn case, like us, you were wondering where that name came from, we’ve referred to politicians who are on their way out as “lame ducks” since the mid-1800s in the U.S. But the term was first used in Britain to describe stock-brokers who couldn’t pay their debts.

It gets in the way of fairness, equal access, and representation. It lowers people's trust in government, and encourages disengagement in the political process. It’s easy for people to be cynical about politics in Illinois because we have a lot of examples of elected officials who abused their power, going back to the earliest days of Illinois statehood. We also have a bunch of former Governors who have served time in prison. And Chicago has been particularly plagued by elected officials who were later convicted of crimes. But corruption is not insurmountable - __if we the people are paying attention__. There are a lot of organizations doing great work on exposing corruption, making ongoing improvements in access to public meetings and records, and, of course, voters play a crucial role at the ballot box. If these great organizations, the voters, and elected officials work together, Illinois can keep rooting out corruption and shady dealing! \n\n### Some organizations investigating politics and corruption in Illinois:\n\n- [Better Government Association](https://www.bettergov.org/)\n- [Chicago Sun Times](https://chicago.suntimes.com/section/the-watchdogs/)\n- [Chicago Tribune](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/politics/)\n- [Illinois Newsroom](https://illinoisnewsroom.org/)\n- [NPR Illinois](http://nprillinois.org/news#stream/0)\n- [ProPublica Illinois](https://www.propublica.org/illinois/)\n- [WBEZ](https://www.wbez.org/)\n\n### What sorts of corruption are people concerned about in Illinois? And what can we do about it?\n\n\n### 1. Explicitly illegal activity:\nSometimes elected officials engage in undisputedly illegal behavior. [Four of the last seven Governors](http://abc7chicago.com/archive/8973798/) in Illinois have done prison time ([Otto Kerner Jr.](https://www.nbcchicago.com/blogs/ward-room/The-12-Most-Corrupt-Public-Officials-In-Illinois-History-Otto-Kerner-137281843.html), [Dan Walker](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/dan-walker-former-illinois-governor-imprisoned-for-fraud-and-perjury-dies/2015/04/29/b3f895d6-ee94-11e4-a55f-38924fca94f9_story.html?utm_term=.3a764f84b49a), [George Ryan](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-george-ryan-scandal-10-years-gallery-20160413-photogallery.html), [Rod Blagojevich](https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/31/politics/who-is-rod-blagojevich-conviction/index.html)) -- though not all of them served time for offenses committed while in office. Illinois has also had a number of elected federal and state officials, and quite a lot of city officials in Chicago, convicted of criminal activity. While this is rightly very upsetting, it doesn’t mean the whole system is rigged, and you shouldn’t just give up and stop caring. In fact, it points to the opposite: the independent investigations that led to all of these prosecutions show our criminal justice system doing its job. And former Governor Rod Blagojevich was [impeached (removed from office) by the Illinois General Assembly](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/chi-blagojevich-impeachment-removal-story.html) once his abuse of power became public knowledge.\n\n\n![Timeline](//images.ctfassets.net/021ulla0m5co/IBC8sqB72Ko0qm0884gMi/c75c0e0499c780b92f91157f489ea7e9/Timeline.jpg)\n\n\n- __Otto Kerner, Jr.__: Governor 1961-1968, [convicted in 1973](http://www.chicagotribune.com/ct-per-flash-govsentences-1211-20111211-story.html) on a mail-fraud charge, [under a law that was later ruled unconstitutional, then revised, and then watered down some more](https://www.chicagoreader.com/Bleader/archives/2011/12/13/the-dubious-law-that-put-otto-kerner-away). He served 7 months of his 3 year sentence, and was released due to ill health.\n\n- __Dan Walker__: Governor 1973-1977, [pled guilty in 1987](https://chicago.suntimes.com/news/dan-walker-ex-governor-with-a-journey-unequaled-by-many-dead-at-92/) to charges of bank fraud, misuse of bank funds, and perjury, for actions after he left office, and spent 18 months in a federal penitentiary.\n\n- __George Ryan__: Governor 1999-2003, [convicted in 2006](https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=16051850) of racketeering, conspiracy, and fraud for taking bribes while serving as Illinois Secretary of State (maybe you’ve heard of the licenses-for-bribes scandal). He spent 5 ½ years in prison.\n\n- __Rod Blagojevich__: Governor 2003-2009, [convicted in 2011](https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/28/us/28blagojevich.html) of corruption and extorting funds while in office as Governor, and sentenced to 14 years in federal prison. \n\n\n\n### 2. Patronage politics:\nWhen elected officials seem to favor some constituents (usually wealthy ones) over others (usually less wealthy ones), or give jobs or favors to their friends and family, it’s called “patronage politics.” While a series of federal court orders ([the Shakman decrees](http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/1138.html)) that instituted federal oversight of hiring in Chicago helped get rid of a lot of patronage politics, it hasn’t vanished entirely. For example, the current Cook County Assessor (an elected official who assigns property values), Joe Berrios lost the [Democratic primary election in 2018](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/politics/ct-met-cook-county-assessor-20180319-story.html) to Frank Kaegi after a [series of investigative reports](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/watchdog/taxdivide/) suggested that his office had been systematically undervaluing corporate property tax rates for big corporations in Cook County. Not only was that an unfair tax break for the corporations, it also put a greater tax burden on small business owners and individual homeowners in Cook County. [Berrios’ office was also under federal oversight](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/watchdog/taxdivide/ct-cook-county-berrios-shakman-met-20171219-story.html) for its history of hiring friends and relatives, a.k.a. [classic political patronage](https://www.propublica.org/article/politic-il-column-cook-county-assessor-race-berrios-kaegi-raila). Democratic primary voters didn’t like Berrios’ track record, and they voted him out of office. __Your vote matters, whether it’s a primary or a general election! __\n\n\n### 3. Unethical behavior:\nWhen elected officials are accused of doing something improper, an ethics review board generally investigates. The ethics enforcers have to be independent for that process to be trustworthy. For a long time, the Legislative Ethics Commission that helps keep the Illinois General Assembly honest had to get approval from leadership (ie. the Speaker of the House) in order to investigate a claim. But, it just got a lot more independent, thanks to a [new law](https://newschannel20.com/news/local/gov-rauner-signs-law-to-improve-illinois-legislative-ethics-complaint-processes) passed with bipartisan support. Increasing public dissatisfaction after an [investigative report on the Legislative Ethics Commission](https://www.bettergov.org/news/states-top-watchdogs-they-bark-dont-bite) helped drive the change! Supporters argue that politicians perceived as untouchable because of their oversight of the ethics process are more likely to be investigated now. Some hope that will apply to the Speaker of the Illinois House who has been criticized for earning money from a law practice that helps businesses in Cook County lower their property tax rates. That’s not illegal, though [some argue that it is a conflict of interest](http://www.nwherald.com/2016/08/16/rep-mcdermed-madigan-makes-millions-in-conflict-of-interest-with-taxpayers-and-chicago-schools/afo6za0/). There’s progress in Chicago too. In 2017, Chicago enacted a [new ordinance](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/politics/ct-chicago-city-council-20171108-story.html) that lets the city inspector general investigate claims of sexual harassment by elected officials including Aldermen and the Mayor.\n\n\n### 4. Dubious use of taxpayer money:\nSometimes folks are referencing questionable use of taxpayer money, like the [golden parachutes](https://www.bettergov.org/news/following-bga-analysis-sen-cullerton-introduces-plan-to-limit-rich-severance-packages) awarded to a number of state employees who left their jobs under a cloud. Or that members of the General Assembly have been able to [use public funds as hush money](https://www.pantagraph.com/herald-review/news/state-and-regional/two-anti-sex-harassment-bills-go-to-rauner-s-desk/article_517916e0-65e0-552c-a6cd-9558edaf06e1.html) to pay off people bringing sexual harassment accusations against them. The good news here is that in 2018 the Illinois General Assembly passed bills outlawing both of these practices and sent them on to the Governor -- __change is possible__! \n\n\n### 5. Police discrimination and corruption:\nThere are some very serious problems with police conduct in Illinois. In 2017, the U.S. Justice Department concluded that the police force in Chicago has a [systemic problem with discrimination and civil rights violations](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-chicago-police-idUSKBN14X1YR), allegations that a [Chicago cop framed 15 people](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/ct-met-chicago-cops-corruption-ronald-watts-20180423-story.html) have caused a wave of exonerations, and there is a disturbing [lack of review or oversight of lethal use of force](http://interactive.wbez.org/taking-cover/deadly-force/) by police in the Chicago suburbs, just to name a few. So, how do you change these practices and restore public trust? First off, the Illinois Attorney General’s office, the City of Chicago, and the Chicago Police Department are working out a [consent decree](http://chicagopoliceconsentdecree.org/) that will change policies governing police training and conduct and provide an independent monitor for the Chicago PD. The consent decree is still in the [public comment period](http://chicagopoliceconsentdecree.org/input/), and won’t be finalized until at least 2019. For everyone outside of Chicago, there’s positive movement too. The Illinois General Assembly sent a bill to the Governor [requiring all police forces in the state to investigate after an officer-involved shooting](https://www.bettergov.org/news/police-shooting-bill-goes-to-governor-s-desk). And [Highland Park adopted new policies](http://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/highland-park/news/ct-hpn-police-pledge-tl-0412-story.html) (developed in coordination with the NAACP) to help restore trust in police. \n\nThere’s a lot to do and a LONGGGG history of wheeling and dealing in our state, but we know that the people of Illinois can help make a change if we get to the polls. You can [register to vote online](https://ova.elections.il.gov/). If you’re not sure whether you’re registered, you can [check your registration status](https://ova.elections.il.gov/RegistrationLookup.aspx) online too.\n\n\n__Read More!__\n[UIC Report on Chicago Corruption](https://pols.uic.edu/docs/default-source/chicago_politics/anti-corruption_reports/continuing-corruption-in-illinois---final-5-22-18.pdf?sfvrsn=2c64fc9a_2)\n\n\n\n\n\n","contributor":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"021ulla0m5co"}},"id":"1v04zNq2NyeAGK40MyiwoW","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-08-06T21:03:06.344Z","updatedAt":"2018-08-06T21:03:06.344Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"contributor"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Anaïs Miodek Bowring","photo":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"021ulla0m5co"}},"id":"1r5lLm8jBWSY6As4WgEmCw","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2018-08-06T21:02:01.938Z","updatedAt":"2018-08-06T21:02:54.727Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":2,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"Anaïs Photo","description":"Headshot","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/021ulla0m5co/1r5lLm8jBWSY6As4WgEmCw/f4df5e78c8fe15928ad515381d448fe5/IMG_3578.jpeg","details":{"size":30530,"image":{"width":420,"height":420}},"fileName":"IMG_3578.jpeg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}}},"bio":"Research \u0026 Curriculum Director"}},"photo":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"021ulla0m5co"}},"id":"7uwhxWUAykeUK0AQwacw2o","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2018-08-06T21:04:35.042Z","updatedAt":"2018-08-06T21:04:35.042Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"Timeline Convicted Governors","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/021ulla0m5co/7uwhxWUAykeUK0AQwacw2o/7bb2cadeaac0d1345b0f55d3f8e8c341/Timeline.jpg","details":{"size":1687507,"image":{"width":3489,"height":1475}},"fileName":"Timeline.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}}}}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"021ulla0m5co"}},"id":"jGQ6nMoM3C8umqCaYG80m","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-06-02T19:35:00.528Z","updatedAt":"2018-06-11T14:56:56.312Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":2,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"article"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"Justice in Just Six Minutes: Know Your Judges on Tuesday’s Primary","body":"We know it’s tempting, but try not to skip through the judicial appointments at the bottom of your ballot on Tuesday, March 20th.

And many judges will be effectively elected to the bench in the primary because they’ll go unchallenged in November. Many others will be reelected without any scrutiny; [since 1990, no Cook County judge has ever lost a retention election](https://chicagotonight.wttw.com/2017/05/01/how-do-cook-county-judges-stack). Read on for more.\n\n### What Do I Need to Know?\n\nVoters choose which judges they’d like to represent their party in the general election — just like any other candidate on the primary ballot. Judges are either seeking reelection (called retention) or are running for a seat left vacant because of retirement, resignation, or death.\n\n### How Do I Pick?\n\nEvaluating judicial candidates can be particularly intimidating, especially because voters often have little to no information about many of these candidates. To avoid potential future ethics issues, candidates generally maintain a degree of political impartiality and don’t express political opinions or promise certain types of outcomes.\n\nCandidates must meet two basic requirements to get on the ballot: they must live in the county or subcircuit district in which they’re running, and they must be licensed to practice law in the State of Illinois. But just like for every other office on your primary ballot, judicial candidates boast varying levels of relevant experience.\n\nThat’s why it’s important to do some homework. Local professional organizations impartially evaluate judicial candidates based on their legal experience and their past conduct. [The Illinois State Bar Association](https://www.isba.org/judicialevaluations/bycounty) has compiled a valuable guide that covers judicial races across the state. Voters can also refer to the [Illinois Civil Justice League](http://www.illinoisjudges.net/)’s district-specific report ([find yours here](http://illinoisjudges.law.northwestern.edu/map-circuits.html)). Cook County voters can also consult both the [Chicago Bar Association](http://www.chicagobar.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Judicial_Evaluation_Committee)’s guide and [Injustice Watch](https://www.injusticewatch.org/news/2018/injustice-watch-2018-cook-county-judicial-voting-guide/)’s comprehensive overview. The latter is well worth your time.\n\n### Some Call to Fix the System\n\nMany legal advocates and politicians fear that some candidates gain an advantage because voters lack the resources or patience to sift through dozens of names on their ballot. Cook County Clerk and former Mayor of Chicago David Orr [has called](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-orr/its-time-to-get-judicial_b_348691.html) for completely overhauling judicial elections to help make them more fair and streamlined. Some legal activists have [called](https://madisonrecord.com/stories/510556675-winning-election-as-judge-in-madison-county-costs-a-lot-more-than-in-other-similar-courts) for all judicial elections to be publicly funded in order to address the exorbitant costs of a single campaign. A 2000 [report](http://www.lib.niu.edu/2000/ii001018.html) showed that winning judges spent an average of $30,000 on their campaigns. In [Madison and Bond](https://madisonrecord.com/stories/510556675-winning-election-as-judge-in-madison-county-costs-a-lot-more-than-in-other-similar-courts) counties, judicial candidates routinely raise over $1m to win their bid for election or retention. Fundraising has become such an important facet in judicial races, that recently [one judge inappropriately solicited](http://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/daily-southtown/news/ct-sta-slowik-blue-island-dispute-st-0222recovered-wed-feb-21-185310-2018--20180221-story.html) donations in a Chicago city council meeting.\n\n### What’s an Appellate Court Judge?\n\nDepending on the area, some voters may be choosing to elect or retain an __appellate court judge__. Illinois has 52 appellate court judges divided into [five districts](http://www.illinoiscourts.gov/AppellateCourt/DistrictMap.asp). Judges serve 10-year terms. Appellate court judges reexamine trial cases and determine whether or not the law was followed or interpreted correctly. They have the power to overrule decisions made by the lower courts.\n\n### What’re Circuit and Subcircuit Court Judges?\n\nAll voters will be choosing candidates to serve 6-year terms as countywide circuit court judges. Residents of [Cook](https://www.elections.il.gov/votinginformation/cooksubcircuits.aspx), [Will](http://www.willcogis.org/website2014/gis/MapGal/Judicial_District_B.pdf), [Lake](http://www.lakecountyil.gov/3514/Election-Precinct-Maps), and some other larger [counties](https://www.elections.il.gov/VotingInformation/DownSubcircuits.aspx) will also vote for subcircuit judges. Circuit court and subcircuit judges function identically, hearing trial cases in their county’s judicial system. Their only difference is how they are elected. While, all county residents vote for the same circuit court candidates, voters will only vote for subcircuit court candidates specific to their area. Subcircuit court appointments [were devised](http://chicagoappleseed.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/electing_judges_in_cook_county_executive_summary.pdf) in 1992 to help make access to the bench more equitable for those in minority communities.","contributor":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"021ulla0m5co"}},"id":"4YAgPSvwROooeCY2mcIAQm","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-06-03T14:49:23.385Z","updatedAt":"2018-06-03T14:49:23.385Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"contributor"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Alexander Jacobs","photo":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"021ulla0m5co"}},"id":"45AnmubDd6AkASGmugioeA","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2018-06-03T14:49:43.584Z","updatedAt":"2018-06-03T14:49:43.584Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"1*qruQJXrbjxWBcSdiI1EzpQ","description":"Alexander Jacobs Alexander Jacobs Editor, Researcher, Writer","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/021ulla0m5co/45AnmubDd6AkASGmugioeA/a62a5daf9698ea0fb2ed8aa179a1b344/1_qruQJXrbjxWBcSdiI1EzpQ.png","details":{"size":66625,"image":{"width":240,"height":240}},"fileName":"1*qruQJXrbjxWBcSdiI1EzpQ.png","contentType":"image/png"}}},"bio":"Editor, Researcher, Writer"}},"photo":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"021ulla0m5co"}},"id":"UFJG3vZ1EA8CcsCmCWiaA","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2018-06-11T14:56:50.662Z","updatedAt":"2018-06-11T14:56:50.662Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"SM Judges 061118","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/021ulla0m5co/UFJG3vZ1EA8CcsCmCWiaA/8ff635ef56d46087ab57a24d8b60f012/SM_Judges_061118.jpg","details":{"size":5613506,"image":{"width":3489,"height":1475}},"fileName":"SM_Judges_061118.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}}}}}]}},"page":"/articles","pathname":"/articles","query":{},"buildId":"0KTMqa7gOGHWDz_FQa01C","nextExport":true};__NEXT_LOADED_PAGES__=[];__NEXT_REGISTER_PAGE=function(r,f){__NEXT_LOADED_PAGES__.push([r, f])}</script><script async="" id="__NEXT_PAGE__/articles" src="/_next/static/0KTMqa7gOGHWDz_FQa01C/pages/articles.js"></script><script async="" id="__NEXT_PAGE__/_app" src="/_next/static/0KTMqa7gOGHWDz_FQa01C/pages/_app.js"></script><script async="" id="__NEXT_PAGE__/_error" src="/_next/static/0KTMqa7gOGHWDz_FQa01C/pages/_error.js"></script><script src="/_next/static/runtime/webpack-42652fa8b82c329c0559.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/commons.b916e297098ab808685c.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/runtime/main-1eeeac80c6968efb1bbd.js" async=""></script></body></html>
